              <p class="lead">Creating games is about more than just a good idea. Turning a good idea in to a good game requires focus,
                   an understanding of what makes a good game and the skills to build the game in a way that captures the fun.

                    <p class="lead">There are theories of game design and play that inform approaches to game design and production. 
                        The importance of an iterative cycle of game development and extensive playtesting cannot be overstated. Here 
                        you will be introduced to the theory and practice of game development.

            <p>You will be coding using Python and Pygame. Python is a very popular programming language. Here the focus will be 
                on how various aspects of games are implemented. Programming 01 teaches you how to code, here the focus will be on using 
                code to make games.
