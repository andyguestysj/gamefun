### Feedback 

The responses to the questions were a mixture of positive and neutral with one negative regarding whether the material stretched the abilities of the students.  

The response on pushing the abilities of the students is fair. First semester modules are very difficult to balance in computing due to the wide range of computing knowledge/skills students start the programmes with. However I agree we could push a bit harder in this module and that will be incorporated in to the revalidated version of this module next semester.  

There were a couple of negative comments about using the Mac machines. These are understandable (and the lecturer fully agrees!), however these are the machines we have available, hopefully they will be upgraded in the near future.  

Comments praised the use of the web pages for presenting material, moodle and the freedom/open nature of the assessment.
