## About Godot Engine
From [https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/introduction.html](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/introduction.html)  

A game engine is a complex tool, and it is therefore difficult to present Godot in a few words. Here's a quick synopsis, which you are free to reuse if you need a quick writeup about Godot Engine.   

  Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) as well as mobile (Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.  

  Godot is completely free and open source under the permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their expectations. It is supported by the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) not-for-profit.
