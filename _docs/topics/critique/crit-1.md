## Game Criticism and Analysis

If we want to make the best games we can we need to know how to critically analyse and discuss games, their content, how they play and how they work. This is different from a game review, though they can overlap. Greg Costikyan describes the difference in the intro to his essay on game criticism.  

> *A review is a buyer’s guide. It exists to tell you about some new product that you can buy, and whether you should or should not buy it. A good review goes beyond that, and suggests who should buy it, since not everyone enjoys everything. (E.g., A romance novel may be very fine of its kind, but is quite unlikely to appeal to me, since it is not a genre I enjoy.)*
>
> *Criticism is an informed discussion, by an intelligent and knowledgeable observer of a medium, of the merits and importance (or lack thereof) of a particular work. Criticism isn’t intended to help the reader decide whether or not to plunk down money on something; some readers’ purchase decisions may be influenced, but guiding their decisions is not the purpose of the critical work. Criticism is, in a sense merely “writing about” — about art, about dance, about theater, about writing, about a game–about any particular work of art. How a critical piece addresses a work, and what approach it takes, may vary widely from critic to critic, and from work to work. There are, in fact, many valid critical approaches to a work, and at any given time, a critique may adopt only one, or several of them.*  

A new review of an old game like Tetris would serve little purpose at this point but a new critique in to the game, or some aspect of the game, can provide insight in to making new games.

## Crit Sessions

Crit sessions are common in the art and design world, including game art and design. They are opportunities for artists and designers to present their plans and work and receive feedback. These sessions are intended to be positive and critical in the fullest sense of the word, rather than the more common use of critical to mean negative. Crit sessions are valuable for everyone involved, getting the chance to see and discuss new ideas and improve work based on the insight of others. People new to crit sessions often are uncomfortable with the idea of them, expecting to be judged and told their work is bad. Generally most people soon find the attitude and atmosphere of crit sessions are positive and any criticism is offered in a good faith attempt to help improve work. People also learn the valuable skill of knowing which feedback to use to improve their work and which feedback is, while still good feedback, not appropriate to that specific piece of work.  

#### Exercise

This week I would like you to sign up to Board Game Arena, a popular online board game playing site. [www.boardgamearena.com](www.boardgamearena.com)  

Once registered I'd like you to split in to groups of 3-4 and play a few games of Battle Sheep. The rule book for Battle Sheep is available on Board Game Arena [here](http://cdn.boardgamearena.net/data/others/battle_sheep_rules.pdf). Battle Sheep is an apparently silly little game with a surprising amount of depth strategically.  

For next week (14/10/20) I'd like you to prepare a critical analysis of Battle Sheep based on today's game play. I'd like you to use the topics and vocabulary described in the Vocabulary section of this modules website (Topic 3. Vocabulary). You may find the two links above (in the Critical Analysis section) useful.  

Don't go overboard with this, I'm not looking for more than a single side of A4's worth of analysis. Email it to me at a.guest@yorksj.ac.uk by 12 noon on Tuesday 13th October. Next week we'll discuss the game and your critiques of it. After the session I'll upload the critiques to the web page, anonymised, so we can see the diffferent approaches and insights you've come up with.
