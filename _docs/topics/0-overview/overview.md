## Module Outline

Design Patterns are well developed solutions to commonly occurring problems in object-oriented programming.  

*Problems* in this case refers to stuff that you commonly need to do in developing object oriented software. These 
problems are things like the creation and management of objects, and communication and synchronisation between objects. THey also cover the dynamic creation of *classes*.  

## Module Content

1. Software Engineering Review
  * Traditional Approach
  * Agile Approach
2. Python Introduction
3. Pygame
4. Agile Project Management
5. Design Patterns

## Why?

Design Patterns are commonly used in industry. Learning about them will help you develop better object oriented code.

## Module Goals

The aims of this module is to gain a good understanding of:  
* how design patterns are structured  
* selecting appropriate design patterns  
* implementing design patterns
* agile software development in a team
* Python and Pygame
 
You should build on your previous skills in  
* analysing a problem and designing a solution  
* coding  

## Assessment

The assessment for this module is in two parts. 

**Group Project** Your group has to design and deliver a game prototype. It should be developed in Python, using Pygame and should run on repl.it.  Your game should be developed using agile project management. Your game should be object-oriented and use at least three design patterns other than the Game Loop and Update patterns (Pygame already handles that for you). The game should be accompanied by a document describing the design patterns used, a description of how and why they were used.

**Reflective Learning Journal** Each student has to submit thier own, personal reflective learning journal. This should be in the form of a journal kept from the start of the project and should detail personal responsibilties and activities for the project, indicate meetings held and attended, etc. It should also have a reflective component where the student looks back over the project and considers what happened. This should describe what worked well and poorly, describe why and what was learned from the experience.

The full brief will be on Moodle and is on the Assessment section of the website.
