Perhaps the hardest part of game development is playtesting. Playtesting is a long process, it is difficult to organise and run, frequently frustrating and sometimes fruitless. It is also the only way to know if your game is any good and the best way to make it better. Ask any game developer and they'll tell you the more you playtest, the more people you get playtesting, the more rounds of playtesting you run, the better your game will be. Playtesting won't guarantee your game is a success but it increases the chances that it will be.  

## Iterative Game Development

Essential to the iterative approach to game development are periods of analysis and testing. The initial iterations of the cycle will be about refining an idea and putting some basic mechanics together. As soon as you get to the point of having a playable game (however incomplete), you'll want to have people playing that game to see if it works and if its any fun.

>We should make clear the distinction between developing **the game** and developing **the code to implement the game**. Both are iterative processes and both will involve playtesting. Ideally we want to develop the game, or the game play if you prefer, and playtest it enough to be happy that it is worth investing time and effort in to developing the code for the game.

>Here we are focusing on playtesting as a tool for improving the game rather than the code. Obviously playtesting of video games is used to improve the code by eliminating bugs and improve functionality.

## Purpose

What are you trying to get out of the playtest?  

* Does the game/rules work?
You should be fairly confident by the time you start playtesting that the game is solid and more or less plays the way you want but you may have concerns about specific parts of the game or if the rules are clear.
* Do other people find it fun?
* Are there issues/problems that you haven’t seen?
Before you do anything else, decide what you hope to get out of the playtest, how the playtest might improve your game.

## Investigators & Playtesters

In the industry, "playtesters" is sometimes used to mean the people playing the game and sometimes used to refer to those running the tests.  
Bond defines the terms:
* *Investigator* - A person administering a playtest, usually someone on your team
* *Playtester* - A person taking part in the playtest by playing games and giving feedback

*Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development*, Bond, Addison Wesley

## Being A Playtester

Every game developer should be a playtester, not just of their own games but for as many other games as you can. Being a playtester will better help you understand playtesting.  

Being a playtester is about more than just turning up and playing a game. Playtesters are there to try and help with the development of the game. 
They should 
* Take the game seriously, try to play it, don’t just mess around
* Play the game as its meant to be played. Don’t try to break it (unless the playtest is specifically for that purpose)
* Ask if there’s particular feedback that is being looked for
* Ask if its okay to ask questions about how to play during the test. 
* Play the game, don’t try to design it. Don’t derail the playtest. 
* Save feedback till the end. Take notes on things you want to mention. 
* Speak to your own experience but never argue against someone else’s experience
* Be specific in your feedback
* Be considerate of both the designers and the other playtesters

## Being A *Great* Playtester

**Think out loud**
* Tell the investigators what you're thinking as you play
* This is especially important on the first play through a game
**Reveal your biases**
* It's difficult for investigators to know where their playtesters are coming from
* As you're playing talk about other games, films, books, experiences, etc. that the game reminds you of
**Self-analyze**
* Help the investigators understand your reactions to the game
* Don't just say "I feel happy."
* It's better to say "I feel happy because the jumping mechanic makes me feel powerful and joyful."
**Separate elements**
* Give overall feedback first
* Then try to analyze art, game mechanics, game feel, sound, music, etc. as individual elements
* This is akin to saying "The cellos sound out of tune," rather than "I didn't like that symphony."
**Don't worry if they don't like your ideas**
* As a fellow game designer, you should tell the investigators any ideas you have to make their game better
* But you also shouldn't be offended if they don't use them
* Both game design and playtesting are about checking your ego at the door

## Circles of Playtesters

Playtesting should be done in stages. Game testing will expand through several circles of playtesters. Each circle of people increases in size and each circle can help with different aspects of your playtesting.

### 1st Circle: You
The designer should be the most frequent playtester of a game. When making a digital prototype, every time you press the Play button in Unity, you're acting as a playtester.  
Your job is to determine whether the game is heading toward the kind of experience your team wants to create. Your skills as a playtester are most useful in the very early stages of prototyping.  
However, you eventually need to show your game to others.  

### 2nd Circle: Trusted Friends

Once you've iterated to the point that your game approximates the experience you were seeking, it's time for more playtesters.  
The 2nd Circle is trusted friends and family members. Preferably those in your target audience or the game dev community.  
Members of the target audience will give you good feedback from the point of view of your future players. Game developers have the experience to give you very good feedback.  
Many game bugs will be found by this circle. This is the first time that anyone who didn't make the game is playing it. They will find many bugs in places you just didn't think to look, because they approach gameplay in a different way. This will often also be the first real test of the server if it's an online game.

### 3rd Circle: Acquaintances and Others
Once the game seems pretty solid, and the 2nd Circle has stopped finding bugs, it's time to expand.  
Finding people outside of those you know well can help tremendously here, because people you know well often share your tastes and biases. You need to get out of you social circle to hear new reactions to a game.  
Where do you find more people?  
* Local universities - See if the university has a student game development club and visit them. Try setting up your game in the quad (with campus permission)
* Local game stores / Malls - People head to these places to buy games, so it could be a fantastic place to get some playtest feedback
* Farmers markets / Community events / Parties

### 4th Circle: The Internet
The Internet can be a scary place. Anonymity ensures that there is little or no accountability. The Internet is also the largest possible circle of playtesters.  
If you're developing an online game, you're eventually going to have to reach out to the Internet and see what happens.  
Internet users will find the most rarified bugs so make sure that they have an easy way to report them. You must also have automated data and user tracking in place. Collect information on every single play session of your game. Much of the best information from this circle will be aggregate data.
