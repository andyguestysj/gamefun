A playtest does not just happen. It is not enough to just hand over the game and ask people to play. To get the most out of a playtest you need to prepare for it.  

## Playtest Preparation

* Keeping your purpose in mind, ensure you have everything you need for the playtest.
  * Prototype, rules, etc
* Decide if you will be actively involved or not
  * Will you participate – probably not a good idea
  * Observe and offer help/rules clarification
    * Might be a good idea in early play tests
  * Stand back and observe but not interact
    * Hard to do but useful in judging completeness of the rules/the complexity of the game
  * Be completely absent during the play and get feedback by
    * interview the players afterward
    * a questionnaire 
* Decide if sticking to a timetable is important or if allowing a game to play out is more important

For early play tests you probably want to be there to ensure that the playtest doesn’t grind to a halt.  
* To offer help understanding the rules (and to take note of why the players needed help)
* To help if situations not covered by the rules come up (and take notes on that too)

For playtests “in the middle” of development you might want to
* Set up specific scenarios/situations to test rules changes
* Be there but only interact if a big problem arises that threatens to derail the playtest
* Be on the look out for specific things
  * How stages of the game play
  * Specific situations

For later testing, when you are confident the game is more or less complete you want to carry out blind playtesting.  
* Provide the players with a complete game and let them play unobserved
* You want to know if the game can be played from the box
* You’ll need to decide how to collect feedback from the players

Have you got everything you need?  
* The game
* The rules
* Players
* A way to take notes/record what happens
* A way to get feedback from the players
* A plan for how the playtest will work
