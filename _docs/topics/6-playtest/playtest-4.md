title: Running A Playtest
permalink: /docs/playtest-4/
---

Hopefully you’ve worked out what you’ll be doing before you get to the playtest. You need to be confident you know and understand the game well enough to 
* Deal with issues (if appropriate)
* Understand what needs to be recorded/taken note of

Make sure you tell the playtesters what type feedback you are looking for. 

During play
* Observe reactions – what they do, how they react when things happen, their mood
* Keep the game flowing – answer quick “how to do this” questions but avoid long discussions
* Monitor your responses – don’t respond to critique with anything more than a thank you, don’t try to defend the game, but do take note of what is said, it might be important
* Remember you are in control – if the playtest heads in the wrong direction, gets sidetracked or bogged down, then get the game moving again. Or end the play test. Sometimes you will just have to stop the game and go away to work out what went wrong.

## Feedback

* Ensure you get the type of feedback you are looking for
  * But don’t force the feedback to say what you want!
* Try to avoid taking the feedback personally
* Try to establish which feedback to act on and which to ignore
* Record all feedback and your reactions to it


## Making Changes

Inevitably playtesting will lead to changes
* Fixes to problems
* Changes to better approaches
* Unnecessary stuff removed
* Minor Tweaks
* Stuff added (be very sure before doing this!)

Try to take a “scientific approach” change one thing at a time and do more testing. Change too much and it is difficult to understand what change led to which effect.  

As always document every change and always note the reason for making it.  

### Look For Red Threads

You don’t need to make changes in response to every comment. Playtesters sometimes miss the point/style of the game and suggest changes that would break the purpose of the game.  
But do pay attention to comments that recur time and time again – they are probably worth taking seriously. Try to get to the core of the comments – what may seem like unrelated feedback at first glance may all be saying the same thing.
