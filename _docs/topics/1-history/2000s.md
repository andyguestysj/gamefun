## A Pattern Begins

Beginning in 2000 we see a pattern on consoles that will be familiar for the next twenty years. Sony's Playstation and Microsoft's XBox will compete for the gamer market while Nintendo produces consoles that appeal to the family market.  

*  2000 – Playstation 2
*  2001 – Xbox
*  2001 – Nintendo Game Cube
*  2005 – Xbox 360
*  2006 – Playstation 3
*  2006 – Nintendo Wii
*  2012 - Nintendo Wii U
*  2013 – Xbox One
*  2013 – Playstation 4
*  2017 - Nintendo Switch
*  2020 - Playstation 5
*  2020 - XBox Series X and S

## Comes Full Circle

While we await the launch of the latest Playstations and XBoxes two names from the past are showing their faces. New Atari and Intellivision consoles are in the works, both intending to provide access to both retro and new games.
