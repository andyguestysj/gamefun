## Pong

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">        
        <p>Pong was the first commercially successful arcade game. It was released in 1972 by Atari. It had no CPU, no code, purely hardware based.  
        </p>
        <p>
        It was fantastically successful, spawning both the arcade game and home console (1975) industries.

## An Early Controversy

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">        
        <p>While Atari’s Pong arcade game was the first commercially successful arcade game, Pong itself was very similar to the Table Tennis game included in the Magnavox Odyssey home video game console. Atari settled out of court and ended up paying royalties to Magnavox.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The Odyssey was a success, though it is debatable which drove the success of the other.

## The Magnavox Odyssey

    <div class="col-md-6">        
        <p>The Magnavox Odyssey was the first commercially successful game console. Like modern consoles it plugged in to a television and came with a controller, though only one.

        <p>
        Games came on cards.

## The Golden Age Of The Arcades

1978-82 was the golden age of arcade games. They were a social phenomenon, kids who couldn’t afford a console could afford a few coins to play an arcade game. The games arcades were where kids hung out and they made incredible amounts of money. Cabinets had to be emptied of coins constantly.  

The games started simple but become more complex and more sophisticated quickly. Pong lead to breakout, breakout lead to Space Invaders.

Space Invaders gave us lives, high score tracking, earning extra lives. These were simple additions, but they became standard features almost immeadiately.  

The genres of arcade games expanded quickly.  

**Shooting games** - Defender, Missile Command, Galaga

**Level/Platform games** - Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Q*bert

They were designed to part kids from coins. They seldom had an end, high score tables challenged and taunted kids to play more. The "just one more go" was essential to their success.  

But during this time two threats were emerging - consoles that ran code and home computers.  

## Second Generation Consoles

First generation consoles operated solely on hardware and this limited the possibilities.  

The Atari 2600 (1977) and the Mattel Intellivision (1979) were among the first consoles that had a CPU that software could be written for. Additonally they had much improved graphics, more sophisticated gameplay and added sound other than simple beeps. Games came on cartridges.  

In 1979 Activision became the first third party developer, producing games for both the Atari and the Intellivision consoles.  

### The Atari 2600

The Atari 2600 came with two joystick controllers for multi-player gaming. Space Invaders was its killer game, driving greater numbers of sales. Atari invested heavily in two licensed games - [Pac-man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_(Atari_2600)) and [E.T the Extra-Terrestrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial_(video_game)). Pac-man became the Atari's best selling game, while ET was such a failure it is credited with the video game crash of 1983. It wasn't wholly responsible for it, market over saturation and a glut of poor quality games were responsible, but the ET game was the biggest single failure.

### The Mattel Intellivision

The Intellivision consolde launched in 1979 and was the first console to challenge the dominance of the Atari. Mattel advertised the 
Intellivision by comparing it directly with the Atari and highlighting its better graphics and sounds. This was the first of the console "wars", though tame by modern standards, it also resulted in people being Intellivision or Atari fans.

Mattel also invested in licensed games like [Advanced Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Dungeons_%26_Dragons:_Cloudy_Mountain) and [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Deadly_Discs). They also invested in licences to produce official sports games for [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_(Intellivision_game)), [NFL Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Football_(video_game)) and [NBA Basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_(Intellivision_game)) among others.
