### Super Nintendo Entertainment System

Nintendo fought back against the Genesis with its next console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the SNES. The SNES struggled initially against the Genesis. At launch the SNES only had one game for every ten available on th Genesis. The Genesis was also cheaper. The Genesis and SNES would compete until the 32-bit systems arrived in the mid 90s. The SNES also gave us iconic characters with Donkey Kong Country and Mario games.

### Nintendo 64

The N64 was launched in 1996 and was named for its 64-bit CPU. It was the last major console to use ROM catridges for its games. Though technically superior to the PLaystation the N64 was launched six months later and the initial uptake of the Playstation meant the N64 never really caught up. It was still successful, selling over 30 million units.

## The Sixth Generation Consoles

### Sega Dreamcast

The Sega Dreamcast, launched in 1998, was the first of the sixth generation consoles. The Dreamcast had a disappointing launch in Japan and in the US initial success fell away as Sony began to hype the launch of the Playstation 2. Sales failed to meet Sega's expectations and the console was discontinued in 2001.
