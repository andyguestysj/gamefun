### Super Nintendo Entertainment System

Nintendo fought back against the Genesis with its next console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the SNES. The SNES struggled initially against the Genesis. At launch the SNES only had one game for every ten available on th Genesis. The Genesis was also cheaper. The Genesis and SNES would compete until the 32-bit systems arrived in the 90s. The SNES also gave us iconic characters with Donkey Kong Country and Mario games.
