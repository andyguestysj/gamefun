## The Video Game Crash Of 1983

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983)

*"The video game crash of 1983 (known as the Atari shock in Japan) was a large-scale recession in the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985, primarily in the United States. The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of game consoles and available games as well as waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America."*  

### Causes
1. **Flooded console market** - consoles were manufactured faster than the market was growing.
2. **Poor quality games** - third party publishing became more and more common in an attempt to feed the demand for games leading to a loss of quality control
3. **Competition from home computers**

## The First Home Computers

In the 1970s the first home computer kits were available. These were hobbyist kits and were *"about as difficult to assemble as a desktop calculater. If you can handle a soldering iron and follow simple instructions, you can build a computer."*

## The Home Computer Takes Off

Home computers started to become popular in the early 1980s. Home computers were no longer kits and could be taken home, connected to a television and switched on. These were programmable computers, most came with a version of the BASIC programming language. Games were available, some systems used cartridges other used audio tapes.  

Popular computers from the early eighties included the Sinclair ZX80, Spectrum, Commodore Vic20 and BBC Micro. 

### Sinclar Spectrum

The Sinclair ZX Spectrum was launched in 1982 by Sir Clive Sinclair's Sinclair Research. It was an 8-bit computer with rubber keys and was somewhat infamous for how hot it would get. It was available in a number of different models and sold over 5 million units across the world.
