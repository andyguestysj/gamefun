## The Video Game Crash Of 1983

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983)

*"The video game crash of 1983 (known as the Atari shock in Japan) was a large-scale recession in the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985, primarily in the United States. The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of game consoles and available games as well as waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America."*  

### Causes
1. **Flooded console market** - consoles were manufactured faster than the market was growing.
2. **Poor quality games** - third party publishing became more and more common in an attempt to feed the demand for games leading to a loss of quality control
3. **Competition from home computers**

## The First Home Computers

In the 1970s the first home computer kits were available. These were hobbyist kits and were *"about as difficult to assemble as a desktop calculater. If you can handle a soldering iron and follow simple instructions, you can build a computer."*

## The Home Computer Takes Off

Home computers started to become popular in the early 1980s. Home computers were no longer kits and could be taken home, connected to a television and switched on. These were programmable computers, most came with a version of the BASIC programming language. Games were available, some systems used cartridges other used audio tapes.  

Popular computers from the early eighties included the Sinclair ZX80, Spectrum, Commodore Vic20 and BBC Micro. 

### Commodore Vic20

The Vic20 was an 8-bit computer. It was designed for and marketed to a wider audience than the hobbyist kit fans of the 70s. It was billed as *"the computer of the future"*. It sold one million units in its first year of production and continued to sell well until it was replace by the Commodore 64 in late 1982.

### Sinclar Spectrum

The Sinclair ZX Spectrum was launched in 1982 by Sir Clive Sinclair's Sinclair Research. It was an 8-bit computer with rubber keys and was somewhat infamous for how hot it would get. It was available in a number of different models and sold over 5 million units across the world.

### BBC Micro

The BBC Micro was another 8-bit computer. The BBC was built by the Acorn Computer company for the BBC Computer Literacy Project. It was 
adopted by most schools in the UK. At more than twice the price of the ZX Spectrum is was never as popular in the home computer market.

### Early Home Computer Games

The first home computers had very small amounts of memory available (by modern standards), and the games were loaded from audio cassettes. These game had to be small.  Small games could be made quickly and by anyone could program. This was a time when kids were making games in their bedrooms and getting them published as commercial games.

At this time people would by magazines and books that contained game code listings, the complete code for a game, printed out for the reader to type back in to their computer.

Usborne publishing have made pdfs of their [early computing books](https://usborne.com/browse-books/features/computer-and-coding-books/) available for free on their website if you'd like to see how I got the first computer games I ever played, and how, along the way, I first learned to code.

## Home Computers Improve, Year After Year

Home computers improved constantly. Hardware was faster and cheaper. More memory, improved graphics and sound quality. Data storage was migrating from audio cassettes to early floppy disks.  

### Commodore 64

The Commodore 64 (C64) replaced the Vic20. It went on to be the highest selling home computer for most of the 1980s.

### Amstrad CPC 6128

The Amstrad CPC 6128 was the third CPC computer produced by Alan Sugar (yes that Alan Sugar). It was initially released in 1985. It came bundled with a monitor and had a built in floppy disk drive.

## The Last Home Computers

Within two years of the CPC 6128 coming out the "last" of the home computers had come out. Two computers now dominated the market for gamers and coders, if only for a little while.

### Atari ST

The Atari ST was much more powerful than early home computers. It came with a built in floppy drive. It came with a GUI based operating system and was mouse and keyboard operated. It had no internal hard drive but they were available as external drives and were popular.
