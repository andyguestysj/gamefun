Game development starts with an analysis stage. If you are taking an iterative approach you will have many analysis stages focusing on different problems to be solved or opportunities to be taken advantage of. 

Our starting point is "I want to make a great game" but that's pretty much always true and not particularly helpful. Perhaps we have some ideas about the type of game we want to design, our its theme or genre. Perhaps we have a clear vision of the game, perhaps just a vague idea. It may be our idea or an idea we've been asked to work on. Whatever the starting point it is worth digging a little deeper and asking ourselves some questions.  

**Who am I designing this game for?**  
Ensure you consider your target audience. A game for children has very different concerns than a game for adults. Specific genres/types of games come with specific expectations about content and gameplay. That isn't to say you can't play against type and you have to pander to your audience's desires, just be aware of what you are doing. Also be aware of the risk of designing a game for yourself, it runs the risk of being only enjoyable to you.  
Another aspect of researching your audience is being aware that what people think they want isn't always what they want.  

**What are my resources?**
While resources includes money, the budget is only one part of the resources available to a project. The time you have available is another resource. You should also factor in the strengths and weaknesses of your team. 

**Prior art research**
Prior art is the games that already exist. No game is truly original, every game is influenced by the games that came before it. You need to be aware of the choices made in those games, what worked and what didn't.

**What is the fastest path to a playable game that demonstrates what I want to test?**
The iterative design approach is coupled with rapid development. The entire point of the iterative approach is to get ideas working as soon as possible so that they can be tested to see if they work and if they are fun. Always try to see if something works before spending time refining and polishing it.
