When we make games we want our players to enjoy them and get the most out of them they can. We want the players to engage with every part of the game we've spent time crafting. For experienced players playing a game of the type they are familiar with this is likely to happen naturally, but for inexperienced players, or players new to a type of game or a game with novel and unusual features, the players may need help in learning how to play the game. *"This requires careful, sometimes invisible, guidance"* (Jeremy Gibson Bond, Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping and Development).  

There are two types of guidance to consider, *direct* where the player knows they are being guided and *indirect* where the guidance is so subtle that players often don't even realise the guidance is there.  

## Direct Guidance

Direct forms of guidance are those that the player is explicitly aware of. The quality of the guidance is determined by four concepts.   

**Immeadiacy** - The guidance is given when it is relevant. Controls are explained as and when they are needed rather than all the controls explained at once. Pop-up messages that say "Press E to talk" when you move next to an NPC for the first time are a good example.  

**Scarcity** - Don't overwhelm the player with too much too soon. Introduce concepts gradually and give the player time to get used to one concept before introducing the next.  

**Brevity** - Keep the guidance as brief as possible without losing meaning and clarity. You want the player to take in the guidance not just skim or skip over it.  

**Clarity** - Be clear about what you are trying to convey.

### Methods

There are a number of direct methods of providing guidance in games.  

#### Instructions

Instructions explicitly tell the player what to do. Instructions may come in the form of text, dialogue with another character, visual diagrams or any combination of the three. These can be the clearest, most explicit form of guidance but they can be overwhelming or annoying and often easily skipped over.

#### Map / Guidance System

A map with waypoints or directional arrows is a good way to guide players to the next location or highlight important locations if the game play is more open. Be aware though that it can lead to some players growing dependant on the waypoints and missing out on anything that isn't highlighted.  

#### Popups

Popups are often used to guide players about the immeadiate situation. They can be used to explain a concept during open world exploration to to teach players to "Press X to dodge" in combat.  

## Indirect Guidance

Indirect guidance is about guiding a player without them being aware that they are being led (as much as possible at least). The quality of indirect guidance depends on two factors.  

**Invisibility** How aware is the player that they are being guided? If the player becomes aware of the guidance will that their experience of the game. 

**Reliability** How often does the indirect guidance influence the player to do what you want? Indirect guidance is subtle and can therefore be unreliable. Indirect guidance requires a lot of testing to ensure it works correctly. It can't be too subtle or it will be missed. It can't be too blatant or it ceases to be indirect.  

### Methods

#### Constraints

Limiting the choices available to players gives you greater control over what happens.

#### Goals

Goals set by the game and by the players themselves will guide how they play. By highlighting or focusing on certain goals the player can be guided to play in a specific way. 

#### Physical Interface

How the player interacts with the game has an impact on how they play and what they try to do in a game. A guitar shaped controller for Guitar Hero helps focus the player on playing music where a standard controller might lead the player to focus on moving around (since that is the more typical use of the controller).

#### Visual Design

The visual design of your can can also help guide the player.

Players will naturally move towards **well lit** areas, even if the game involves hiding in shadows. **Similarity** can be used to indicate good things (healing, treasure, etc.). **Trails** can be explicit or implicit, a trail of similar items can guide a player along a path. **Landmarks** that stand out from the background naturally draw attention towards them.
