Audio feedback occurs when a microphone is placed in front of a speaker. The sound from the speaker keeps being re-amplified. You may have experienced this in multi-person voice chat.  

All games have feedback systems - actions and results in one turn affect subsequent turns.  

Game feedback can either be positive or negative
* Positive - If someone starts winning, their chances of winning get better and better
  * "Positive" in this case does NOT always mean "good"
* Negative - If someone starts winning the game, negative feedback slows them down and helps other people catch up

## Features of Positive Feedback Games
* The winner keeps winning
* An early lead often determines the winner
* Generally frowned upon in multiplayer games
* But, it can keep games short!
* Single-player games often have positive feedback to help the player feel more powerful
Examples of Positive Feedback Games
* Poker - Once a player has more chips than everyone else, it's easier for her to bluff and force others to fold
* Monopoly - Once a player has more money than everyone else, she will continue to acquire more property and thereby more rent

## Features of Negative Feedback Games
* The winner is slowed
* An early lead often does not determine the winner
* The last-place player is given bonuses to help her
* Tends to make multiplayer games take longer
* Rarely used in single-player games
Examples of Negative Feedback Games - *Mario Kart*
* Players in the worst places get speed boosts
* Players in the worst places "randomly" get much better weapons
* Last place players get items like the Lightning Bolt, which slows down every other player in the race
* First place players will only get bananas (a defensive weapon), a set of three bananas, or green shells (the weakest attack)
