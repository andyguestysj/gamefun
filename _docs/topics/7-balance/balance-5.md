Audio feedback occurs when a microphone is placed in front of a speaker. The sound from the speaker keeps being re-amplified. You may have experienced this in multi-person voice chat.  

All games have feedback systems - actions and results in one turn affect subsequent turns.  

Game feedback can either be positive or negative
* Positive - If someone starts winning, their chances of winning get better and better
  * "Positive" in this case does NOT always mean "good"
* Negative - If someone starts winning the game, negative feedback slows them down and helps other people catch up
