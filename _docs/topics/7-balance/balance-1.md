## Game Balance

*Balance* means different things depending on the context - 
* In Multiplayer Games, balance most often means fairness
  * Each player should have an equal chance of winning the game
  * Most easily accomplished in symmetric games where each player has the same starting point and abilities
  * Balancing an asymmetric game is considerably more difficult and requires extensive playtesting
* In Single-Player Games, balance means
  * The game is at an appropriate level of difficulty for the player
  * The difficulty changes gradually
  * If a game has a large jump in difficulty at any point, that point becomes a place where the game will tend to lose players

"*Change a number, and you change the experience. Period.*" â€“ Chris Swain - Game Designer & Professor  

Because numbers have such a profound effect on games, you must understand some simple math concepts to balance games well. This includes:  
* Understanding probability
* An exploration of different randomizers for paper games
* Weighted distribution
* Permutations
* Positive and negative feedback

### Using Spreadsheets to Balance Games

Spreadsheet programs are often used by game designers to explore issues of balance.  
* They can help you quickly grasp gestalt information which allows you to make decisions based on numbers, not instinct
* Spreadsheet charts can help convince non-designers of the validity of game design decisions

#### Understanding/visualizing probabilities

</centre>
There are 36 different possible rolls of 2d6  
The different results have a different chance of happening  

#### The Maths of Probability

Writing down every roll like this is enumeration  
It's also possible to determine the number of possible rolls with math  

      6    possible rolls for Die A
    x 6    possible rolls for Die B
   = 36    total possible rolls

Probability as a mathematical study was started by Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat.
