## Twine 2: How to Create Your First Story

Work your way through the Twine 2 tutorial at [https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:how_to_create_your_first_story](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:how_to_create_your_first_story).  This will give you the basics of how to create passages, how to create links between them and play the games you create.  

An alternate first story tutorial is here [https://damonwakes.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/twine-for-beginners-pen-and-paper-stories/#more-1900](https://damonwakes.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/twine-for-beginners-pen-and-paper-stories/#more-1900) It may be a little out of date but the basics are sound.  

If you prefer to watch tutorial videos then [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOPqJzXWgo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOPqJzXWgo) is very good.  

## More Detail

There are a number of tutorials / guides / reference pages linked from [https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide).  

I'd recommend having a quick read over the following pages for more detail on the basics
* [How to Create Links](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:how_to_create_links)
* [How to Format Text](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:how_to_format_text)

The reference section is also good for looking up how to do things.    

There is a Reddit post containing links to lots of tutorials and tips on various Twine topics here [https://www.reddit.com/r/twinegames/comments/au74yc/collection_of_tutorials_ive_found_useful_while/](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinegames/comments/au74yc/collection_of_tutorials_ive_found_useful_while/)  

## Task 

Create your own interactive story game. Either create a story from scratch, make a non-interactive story interactive or create a choose your own adventure version of computer game. Not Pong, that would be really dull. Any RPG would be good. Pretty much any game where you control a character and have to decide what to do would work. Among Us could make for a fun CYOA.
