This module involves programming. We will be using Pygame for Python to develop a game.  

But, in the words of Douglas Adams, [Don't Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).  

This is not a *programming module*. It is a module about game development theory and practice and the programming gives you a chance to see these in action.  

Programming 01 will teach you how to programme and how to do that in Java.

Programming consists of a number of different skills.  
* Breaking a problem in to a number of smaller and smaller problems  
* Working out the logic of solving those small problems  
* Turning that logic in to code  

The first two skills are (mostly) language independent, the processes are the same regardless of which programming language you use.  

The third skill, turning logic in to code, is obviously language specific. However for most programming languages that code is very similar - 'if ()' statements all look kinda similar, 'for()' loops vary a little more but are easily recognisable. Once you know one language it is easier and faster to learn another.  

Games Fundamentals will introduce you to Python and show you how to use the techniques you learn in Programming 01 in Python.  

That said, I will generally give you the code to implement various game features, you shouldn't need to do much more than tweak it to your game. Again the focus of this module is on the theories and practices of game development rather than game coding.

### Python Programming Language

Python is very similar to Java. It has a few oddities of its own but is, overall, much like Java. You will pick it up quickly and 
easily. Python is often used as a scripting language. There are many free libraries out there and we will be using Pygame, a library designed for making games.


### Programming

Please remember, programming is a **knowledge** and a **skill**. I can provide you with information in the form of lectures, tutorials and point you at books to help you learn the **knowledge** but the **skill** comes from practice. The **skill** only comes from writing code.
