We will be using assorted software and programming tools in this module. This page will link to resources for the software and tools.  

## Moodle

The Moodle page for this module is the key information source. It will have the assessment brief, deadlines, submission information and assessment feedback.  

If there are any contradictions between Moodle and other sources the Moodle information should be considered correct. 

## Website

The content for the module will be provided through the Games Fundamentals webpage [https://ysjgamefun.netlify.app/](https://ysjgamefun.netlify.app/). Moodle isn't suitable for presenting the information, videos and tutorials required. There is a link to the webpage on Moodle.

## eMail

eMail is the primary communication method for this module. Please check your email each week day so we can update you on any changes. I advise checking your email shortly before any timetabled session in case of changes.  

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:a.guest@yorksj.ac.uk). You can also message me through MS Teams.

## Microsoft Teams

MS Teams will be used for all face to face contact. Lab/tutorial session will be run as live MS Teams sessions. Please install MS Teams on your machines if you can, the web version is limited and a bit flaky.  

## replit.com

We used replit.com last year to help us during the covid pandemic. replit.com can be used again this year but it is not required.  

One of the "languages" replit.com supports is Python with Pygame, making it very easy for us to set up and develop games directly in the browser.

You **can** come in to the labs, during your timetabled sessions, if you wish or do not have access to a machine at home. Be aware that I will not be in the labs, I will be running the session remotely. You will also need to bring headphones to use, ideally with built-in microphone if you want to speak to me or other students.  

You can sign up for a replit.com account for free at [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/). I recommend you do so using your York St John email account address.  

The replit.com page on this site (under the Reference section) contains instructions and tips for using replit.com.  

## Git

We will be using Git to store code repositories and submit code. replit.com has very good integration with GitHub and can pull and push code from our GitLab (with a little bit of setup). Information on how to do this is on the replit.com page.
